# StoryApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.4. and bases on the approach to Connect Angular Forms to @ngrx/store from [Netanel Basal](https://netbasal.medium.com) described in his blog article [Connect Angular Forms to @ngrx/store](https://netbasal.com/connect-angular-forms-to-ngrx-store-c495d17e129). The data in the form is pushed for every user input into the store. And is populated in the form after that by component init.

I decided to publish this demo because firstly the code in the blog article and his code in gist is from 2017 and not compatible with Angular 12. Secondly I found the article itself and the code in gist not very helpful for me as an Angular beginner.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Not tests

## Running end-to-end tests

No tests
